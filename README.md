# Voron_v1.6.2
Updates the Voron v1.6 branch to bring it in line with generation v1.8 build ethos. The key difference is that v1.6 generation printers utilise linear rods for guides rather than linear rails.

Updated the v1.6.2 to v1.6.2 'Darklake'. Aesthetic of printed parts has been altered to better suit the design language of the Stealthburner toolhead.

v1.6.2 supports build plates from 200x200mm. Theoretically, the design allows for build plates from 150x150mm, however this is as yet physically untested. The z_motor_mounts are slightly narrower to allow placement between the z_shaft_retainers on the smallest build size. Bottom skirts still utilise 250mm left, right and power items but with custom 'middle' skirts. 

v1.6.2 supports Afterburner toolhead, I intend to port Stealthburner in the future. Modified parts include carriage frames, printhead mounts and belt clips. Please note, although carriage frames will fit v1.6, the belt path is consistent with v1.8 and therefore not compatible without modification. The connector_cover (also referred to as the 'hood') has been modified to allow slightly more packaging space and the chain_anchor features two slots ahead of the heatsert holes to enable the use of a cable tie ('zip tie'). I only have access to, and therefore have only supported, E3D v6 style printheads.

v1.6.2 XY joints are completely redesigned to bring belt path alignment consistent with v1.8 AB drives. v1.6.2 Front Idlers are adapted from v2.4r2. XY Joints have been updated to more accurate idler placements.

Controller board mounts for Fly Mini v1, TwoTrees E3 DIP, Ramps 1.4 and Raspberry Pi Zero are included under the 'Unsupported Controllers' directory. 

Panel mounting for 3mm acrylic panels is styled sympathetically to the bottom skirt 'honeycomb' aesthetic. Low profile snap clips are utilised for securing the front panel and rear electronics door.

Please follow the build guide for v1.8 printers as provided by the Voron development team. They already offer a substantial amount of information which covers every aspect of building a functional machine.
