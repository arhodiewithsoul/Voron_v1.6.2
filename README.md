# Voron_v1.6.2
Updates the Voron v1.6 branch to bring it in line with the current generation Voron v1.8. The key difference is that v1.6 generation utilise linear rods for guides rather than linear rails.

v1.6.2 supports build plates from 200x200mm. The z_motor_mounts are slightly slimmer to allow placement between the z_shaft_retainers on the smallest build size. Bottom skirts still utilise 250mm left, right and power items but with 200mm middles. 

v1.6.2 supports Afterburner toolhead. Modified parts include carriage frames, printhead mounts and belt clips. Please note, although carriage frames will fit v1.6, the belt path is consistent with v1.8 and therefore not compatible without modification. The connector_cover (also referred to as the 'hood') has been modified to allow slightly more packaging space and the chain_anchor features two slots ahead of the heatsert holes to enable the use of a cable tie ('zip tie'). Designed for use with E3D v6 printheads.

v1.6.2 XY joints are completely redesigned to bring belt path alignment consistent with v1.8 AB drives.

Controller board mounts for Fly Mini v1, TwoTrees E3 DIP, Ramps 1.4 and Raspberry Pi Zero are included under the 'Unsupported Controller' directory. Panel mounting for 3mm acrylic panels is styled sympathetically to bottom skirt aesthetic.

Please follow the build guide for v1.8 printers as provided by the Voron development team. They already offer a substantial amount of information which covers every aspect of building a functional machine.
